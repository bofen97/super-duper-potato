         S AMPLE E FFICIENT A CTOR -C RITIC WITH EXPERIENCE REPLAY [1] . 



The dependency package is as follows (this is not complete)
requirements:         
	rlschool,        
	paddlepaddle-gpu==1.5.1.post97 ,           
	parl                

I think using conda will be more "safe" , view setup.sh.        


Using xparl[2][3] parallel tools .        
Xparl is an efficient parallel tool that is very easy to use :)           



xparl start --port 6006     
cd ACER/        
python learner.py
